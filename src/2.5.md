# More on Implications

Recall: \\(P \implies Q\\) is a *statement* built from *statements*.

Now: \\(P(x) \implies Q(x)\\) is a *statement* built from *open sentences*. This is the form of **most** theorems.

Example:

\\[
    \\begin{align}
        P(x)&: x = -3\\\\
        Q(x)&: |x| = 3
    \\end{align}\\\\
    \text{If } x = -3, \text{ then } |x| = 3.
\\]
