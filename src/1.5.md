# 1.5 Partitions of Sets

<div class="def">

**Pairwise Disjoint**: *Let \\(A\\) be a set. A collection \\(S\\) of subsets of \\(A\\) is **pairwise disjoint** if every two distinct sets in \\(S\\) are disjoint.*
</div>

<div class="def">

**Partition**: *Let \\(A\\) be a set. If \\(S\\) is a collection of **non-empty** subsets of \\(A\\) and*
1. \\(S\\) is pairwise disjoint and
2. the union of the subsets in \\(S\\) is \\(A\\)

then we say \\(S\\) is a **partition** of \\(A\\).
</div>

This can be useful if, for example, we're trying to prove a theorem for the integers \\(Z\\). If we can prove the theorem for each partition, for example the positives, negatives, and zero separately, then we prove for the whole set \\(Z\\).
